# INFO 253A - Final Project Instructions

## Objective

### For this project you will accomplish the following:
- Build an API of your choosing with yourself and 4-5 other team members
- Learn how to collaborate to build a React application
- Show off your Front-End skills

### The project is split into three parts
1. Defining your project with your assigned team
2. Implementing your project idea, presenting to the class
3. And writing about it.

### Your team must complete the following:
1. Think of a front end web application that you would like to build
2. Build the front end web application that you came up with
3. Utilize at least one external API
4. Demo the front end web application and present it to the rest of the class
5. Submit a write-up that consists of a description and the purpose of your application and talks about the API that you used

## Project Implementation

This is the part where you implement your web application using REACT. Happy Coding!

- Each team will have one repository where they will push their changes. Please use this new repository for all work on this project.
- This could be the first time where you are using GitHub while collaborating with others. Beware of merge conflicts and editing the same file with someone else.
    - git pull often
- Commit all changes in the repo
- Prepare and deliver your project and a presentation
    - Prep for a 5 minute presentation
    - Limit your slides to 5 pages max. Demoing your application in-person is imperative.

# Proposal

INFO 253A - Project Brief - Team 9
Members: Ankita Shanbhag, Tyler Wu, Olivia Zhao, Shubham Roy

## Objective

As a part of our project, we intend to build a puzzle-based fun quiz wherein a single player will answer questions, leverage hints, and complete the quiz.

  - For the MVP, we see this as a single-player quiz
  - Since there are 4 members, we intend on having a quiz of 4 levels- one question per level.
  - Each question would leverage an external API depending on the interests of the group members. For example, one question could leverage maps APIs while the other could leverage a Spotify API. We are yet to finalize the list of our final APIs but this is the direction we intend to take. Our choice of the API would be based on what makes the quiz more fun and also what aligns with the interest of the members.
    -- Please note: We might end up using a single API for all the questions or multiple APIs across questions. 
  - It will be a timed quiz
    -- Each question can have its own timer
    -- Hints would be shown either when the user asks for them or based on the timer.
  - Users will be able to move to the next level only when they answer the question correctly.
  - Constraints
    -- We will not ask the end user to sign-up. Hence, there will be no storage of their gameplay progress if they refresh during the game.
  - Future scope [not necessarily part of this project]
    -- Multi-player support
    -- Allowing the user to pick a category for the quiz, for example, questions only on music or only on maps or a combination, etc
